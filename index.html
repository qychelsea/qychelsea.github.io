			<h1>3. Census</h1>
			<p>
                The latest census reports show that a number of second-tier cities are experiencing a wave of tourism boom and Nashville TN is one of the most fast-growing travel destinations in the country.</br>
                By taking a closer look at the change in number of tourism related businesses in Nashville's various districts from 1998 to 2015, the change in the level of economic activities becomes apparent, especially in the downtown districts.</br>

			<h1>4. Final Project</h1>
			<p>
				Our auditory experience is so distinct from our visual experience as it can never be grasped as a whole. While one can quickly get a sense of the rough compositional proportion and geometric relationship by glancing at Mondrian's paintings, the contrapuntal complexity and rhythmic correlation in Bach's 'The Art of Fugue' only unfold with time. To me, it will be a lost opportunity to think that a certain type of art can only be perceived by the single channel of bodily sense it is intended for. This music visualization project tries to build an integrated auditory and visual experience by offering a new way to appreciate musical masterpieces.

She has interned as an architectural designer in different countries before graduating from the University of Waterloo in 2015. At MIT, she has developed an interest in visualization and digital fabrication. Yue (Chelsea) Qiu is currently a third-year Master of Architecture student at MIT.
