        <h1>Music Visualized</h1>


        <p>Our auditory experience is so distinct from our visual experience as it can never be grasped as a whole.
          While one can quickly get a sense of the rough compositional proportion and geometric relationship by glancing at Mondrian's paintings, the contrapuntal complexity and rhythmic correlation in
          Bach's <span>'The Art of Fugue'</span> only unfold with time.
          This music visualization project tries to build an integrated auditory and visual experience by offering a new way to appreciate musical masterpieces. </p>
